                                                <p> You may have randomly found this website, but this is just an experiment/practice of my HTML skills. My main website which is hosted and ran on Google Sites can be found <a href="https://www.osaym.com/">Here.</a> Please take a look, as it's very cool!</p>

                                                <h1>The World's Neatest Website - Written By Osaym Omar</h1>
                                                <p>So you want to know the world's neatest website, huh? Well, in my opinion I think it is <a href="http://www.gucci.com">Gucci.</a> Gucci is a cool website for many reasons, with one being that it has a very cool shadow in the header, and includes revolutionary animations as you scroll down from the index page. Some other notable elements the code has is embedded video players, and a cool footer.</p>

                                                <h1>The World's Ugliest Website - Written By Osaym Omar</h1>
                                                <p>I don't think that this one is directly obvious. The world's ugliest website is <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berksire Hathaway.</a> Berkshire Hathaway is an American multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. This one comes to surprise, as Berkshire Hathaway is owned by the richest man in the world, Warren Buffet! You would think that he would hire a professional website creating team to build his company's website, but apparently not!</p>

                                                <p>Do you know what a favicon is? A favicon is the image thingy you can see at the top of the tab. Look at mine! It's My logo designed by my friend FuseFall! Here is the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ofl4sdQ.png">image</a> if you like it!</p>
